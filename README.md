FishGems
=====================================================
*(Project ProeveVanBekwaamheid)*

You're the captain of the S.S Cash Crab, the most *creative* ship of the seven seas.

A ship with a mission; to catch as many **FishGems** as possible.

All the fishes has their own gemcolor.
And the ship has a hook made for every color.

Your job is to sail the sea, heel the fish with the same color as your hook and earn as much points as possible before the time runs out.
